# Basic Blu Theme
This theme is very adaptable and flexible for whatever color scheme or font families you would like to use for your game. This has all of Blu's favorite code and is a great starting place for your Ares project.

## Changing Colors
Use the built-in Theme Colors in the setup options. It will automatically update all the colors in the theme. Please note: the Muted Rainbow and Greyscale colors can now be found in the `rainbow.scss` under `Admin > Setup`.

## Changing Fonts
Select your favorite fonts from Google Fonts. You can import them using the @import feature. To update the fonts across the game, merely update the fonts in the `fonts.scss` under `Admin > Setup`.

## Unique Features

* Grid display has been utilized instead of Flex. Why? Because I like it! Ha!
* Icon design that does not have the nameplate threatening to take a character off at the chin.
* Unique character cards access in scenes that provide a stable space with scroll. Are you using [Simple Inventory](https://github.com/spiritlake/ares-simpleinventory-plugin) by Tat? Cool! I can help you add tabs to your character cards! Just let me know!
* Scroll tabs so they do not stack unattractively and are better in mobile (check for scroll bars).

## Warning!
The images you see in the home screenshot are not part of this theme package!

## A Couple Notes for Light Themes
As this theme was developed as a dark theme, there are a few small changes I recommend you make for themes with lighter backgrounds.

First, I recommend you change all iterations of $DARK-GREY to $LIGHTER-GREY and $DARKER-GREY to $LIGHT-GREY.

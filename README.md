# Basic Blu Theme
This theme is very adaptable and flexible for whatever color scheme or font families you would like to use for your game. This has all of Blu's favorite code and is a great starting place for your Ares project.

## Changing Colors
Use the built-in Theme Colors in the setup options. It will automatically update all the colors in the theme. The muted rainbow colors and shades-of-grey can be tweaked in the CSS style file itself.

## Changing Fonts
Select your favorite fonts from Google Fonts. You can import them using the @import feature. To update the fonts across the game, merely update the fonts in the top section of the CSS style file where you see "$body-font," "$primary-font," and "$secondary-font."

## Unique Features
This theme package has some unique features!

* If you use FS3, the Attribute, Skill, and Advantage dots on both the character sheet and character scene card will match the color scheme in the client;
* Job categories have been colored in rainbow order;
* Mobile response has been added and updated in a variety of elements;
* Calendar will utilize your theme colors.
* ProseMirror input styled to fit BasicBlu theme.

## A Couple Notes for Light Themes
As this theme was developed as a dark theme, there are a few small changes I recommend you make for themes with lighter backgrounds.

First, I recommend you change all iterations of $DARK-GREY to $LIGHTER-GREY and $DARKER-GREY to $LIGHT-GREY.
